This script generates plots showing examples of wholesale electricity markets with multiple/unique 
equilbria under different probability distributions for demand. 

These plots appear in the paper: Chaiken, B., and Duggan, J. "A note on the uniqueness of Nashâ€“Cournot 
equilibria in an oligopolistic energy market with renewable generation and demand uncertainty", Energy Economics, October 2024
